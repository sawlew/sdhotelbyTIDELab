            <h2><span>The History</span> Of Our Hotel</h2>
            <p>
                In 1792 the first publicly held hotel, 
                 called the City Hotel, opened in NYC.<br>
                 The first hotel in the present sense of the word, 
                 the Tremont House, opened in Boston in 1829.<br><br>
                 It was a quite remarkable place, that set many “firsts” for the industry.<br>
                 Most notably it was the first hotel with indoor plumbing and indoor toilets and baths.<br>
                 It was also the pioneer in terms of reception as well as everyone’s favourite – free soap.<br>
                 Another big milestone is the creation of the first business hotel, the Buffalo Statler, in 1908.

                 But what sparked the beginning of the modern era for the travel industry?<br>
                 Many claim it was the birth of leisure cruising. It started with the formation of the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company in 1822.<br><br>
                 The company started out as the shipping line between European countries, but fairly quickly grew and started cruises to other continents as well.<br>
                 Transatlantic liners made travel industry richer, and hotels more sought for. Post-war consumer boom was yet another reason for the growth of the travel industry.<br>
                 1950’s brought us the Club Méditerranée SA. This company was selling all-in holidays in usually exotic locations.
